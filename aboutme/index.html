    <p>Hey, Everyone. 
        As a student in BYU-I I am studying computer science. 
           As I do that I am incredibly lucky to be a wife and mother to four kiddos ranging in age twelve to four. 
        I am excited to learn webdesign. I have my own ideas and can't wait for ways to use the skills I aquire here for my own benefits. 
        It will also be so fun to design and create.
           As a convert to the church of Jesus Christ about thirteen years ago I have gained a lot of insights.
        My favorite is the temple blessings my husband and I got to make five years after joining the church and marrying. It was so special.
        Especially as we had two of our children and I was expecting our third so they got to come in and be sealed to us. It was life changing.
