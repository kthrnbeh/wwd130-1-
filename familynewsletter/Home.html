     <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
      Family is the most important thing, but we don’t always have the ability to meet up.
      While we wait to see each other, our newsletter will share updates, photos, and milestones
      so loved ones can feel connected. It’s a simple way to keep grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins,
      and friends in the loop.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are our Family updates, photos and fun things were ready to do. Keep up with the Magistri's 
      see our magic moments and life details here.
